   I began working on increasing my knowledge, I realised that what I learned in university was simply how it all works, and some things I can do with it. I have learned about applications, compilers, languages, frameworks and libraries.

   For the next stage in personal development, I am looking towards continuous integration and continuous delivery as parts of the DevOps role.
